## People Power

> **Key:**  Purposefully place yourself beside excellent programmers.

### What to do

  * You could make this kind of relationship formal with mentorship
  * As you do this, learn from them. Watch out for:
      * How they think and solve puzzles
      * How they plan a route into problems
      * The attitude they adopt when things get hard
      * How they know to keep pushing on a problem, when to take a break, or when try a different approach.
      
### Know your experts

  * Consideer carefully what you think an excellent programmer looks like.

### 20/2 Hindsights

  * An interesting and beneficial side effect of working with good coders is that you are far more likely to end up working with good code.

## It's the Thought That Accounts

### Accountability Counts

> **Key:**  Being accountable to other programmers for the quality of your work will dramatically improve the quality of your coding

### Code++

  * To ensure you're crafting excellent code, you need people who are checking it at every step of the way.
  * People who will make sure you're working to the best of your ability, and are keeping up to the quality standard of the project you're working on.

### Making it work

> **Key:**  If you know that someone else will read the comment on your code, you're more likley to write good code.

### Setting the standard

  * When building developer accountability into your daily routine, it is worth spending a while considering the benchmark that you're aiming for.

## Speak Up!

### Code is communication

#### Talking to the machines

> **Key:**  Code is communication with the computer. It must be clear and unambiguous if your instructions are to be carried out as you intend

#### Talking to the animals

> **Key:** Your code is communication to other humans. Including you. It must be clear and unambiguous if others are to maintain it.

> **Key:** More comments do not necessarily make your code better. Communicate code does not need extra commentary to prop it up.

> **Key:** How well code communicates depends on the programming language, idioms, employed, and the underlying natural language. All these have to be understood by the readership.

#### Talking to Tools

  * Our code communicates even further - to other tools that work with it.

### Interpersonal Communication

#### Ways to Converse

> **Key:**  Master the different forms of communication. Use the appropriate mechanism for each conversation

#### Watch your language

> **Key:**  Take care to use the right vocabulary with the right people

####  Body language

####  Parallel Communication

> **Key:**  Effective communication requires focus

### Talking of Teams

> **Key:**  Good communication fosters good code. The shape of your communications will shape your code.

> **Key:**  Speak to others transparently, with a healthy attitude, to foster effective teamwork

### Talking to the customer

  * We have to understand what the customer wants, otherwise we can't build it.
  
## Many-festos

### A generic Manifesto for software development

  * We believe in a fixed set of immutable ideals over tailoring our approach to each specific situation
  * We believe in concentrating on and discussing only the things that interest us over the bigger problem
  * We believe in our pinion over the opinions and experiences of others.
  * We believe in arbitraty black-and-white mandates over real-world scenarios with complex issues and delicate resolutions.
  * We believe that when our approach is hard to follow then it only shows how much more important it is.
  * We believe in crafting an arbitraty set of commandments over the realisation that it's just never that simple
  * We believe in trying to establish a movement to promote our view over something that will be genuinely useful
  * We believe that we are better developers than those who don't agree with use because they don't agree with us
  
### The Manyfestos

> **Key:**  Learn about development methodologies, trends, manifestos, and fads.

### But, Really?

> **Key:**  Subscribe to development manifestos that seem sensible. But don't blidnly follow them, and don't treat them dogmatically.

### The Punchline

  * Care about the code
  * Empower your team
  * Keep it simple
  * Use your brain
  * Nothing is set in stone
  * Learn. Constantly.
  * Seek to improve. Constantly.
  * Always deliver value, considering the long term
  
## An Ode to Code

### Coding is a people problem

> **Key:**  Often, the tricky part of software development isn't in the technical aspects of the code; it's the people problems.

> **Key:**  When surrounded by coders who do not care about the code, maintain healthy attitudes yourself. Beware of absorbing bad practices by osmosis.
