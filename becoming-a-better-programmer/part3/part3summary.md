## Live to Love to Learn

> **Key:** Be in a state of continual learning. Always look to learn something new.

> **Key:** Learn to enjoy learning

### What to learn?

  * Learn a new technology
  * Learn new technical skills
  * Learn a new problem domain
  * Learn how to learn
  * Learn something completely different
  
### Learning to Learn

> **Key:** Our learning is often too narrowly focused. Consider a wider sphere of reference. Draw inspiration from many fields.

> **Key:**  Use as many sources as possible to improve the quality of your learning.

> **Key:**  Takes notes as you learn. Even if you throw them away.

####  The Four Stages of Competence

 * Conscious incompetence
   * You don't know something. But you know that you're ignorant.
 * Conscious competence
   * You know something. And you know that you know it.
 * Unconscious competence
   * When your knowledge of a topic is so great that is has become second nature
 * Unconscious incompetence
   * You don't know that you don't know something.
    
### Learning Models

  * There are five specific levels of understanding:
    * Novice
      * A complete newbie.
    * Advanced beginner
      * At this level there is a better understanding of where to get answers but you are still not at a level where you can comprehend the bigger picture.
    * Competent
      * This stage sees you with a mental model of the problem domain; you've mapped the knowledge base, have begun to associate its parts, and understand the relative importance of difference aspects.
    * Proficient
      * Proficient people move beyond competency. They have a much better understanding of the big picture, and are frustrated with the simplifications that the novice needed.
    * Expert
      * Experts are the authorities on a subject; they know it completely, and can use this skill interlinked with other skills. They can teach others.

### The Knowledge Portfolio

> **Key:**  Purposefullyy manage your knowledge portfolio

### Teach to Learn

> **Key:**  Teach a topic to learn that topic well

### Act to Learn

> **Key:**  Using what you just learned cements it in your memory. Try examples, answer questions, create pet projects.

## Test-Driven Developers

### Driving the Point Home

 * Once software developers gain a mastery of their tools and languages, they are freed to see the bigger shape of the problem to be solved.
 * The majority of coding disasters are due to programmer error. Crashes happen to programs, but they are caused by the people who learnt to write them.
 
### Success Breeds Complacency

> **Key:** Beware of becoming complacent when you reach a state of "competence." Always code with your brain fully engaged to avoid silly, potentially dangerous, errors.

### Testing Times

 * The driving test ensures that a complex human activity does not end in disaster. It doesn't just encourage people to be good drivers based on good intentions, but mandates it.

## Relish the Challenge

### It's the Motivation

 * Nobody likes a stale programmer. Least of all, yourself

### What's the Challenge?

 * What excites you about programming? Think about what you'd like to work on right now and why.

### Don't Do It!

 * It is exactly because we have to perform dull tasks all day that we should also seek to balance them with the exciting challenges.
 * We must be responsible in how we use our time to do this, and whether we use the resulting code or throw it away.

### Get Challenged

 * Work out what you'd like to do. And then do it:
    * Perform some code katas
    * Finding a coding problem you'd like to solve, just for the fun of it.
    * Kick off a personal project.
    * Maintain a broad field of personal interest
    * Don't ignore other platforms and paradigms.
    * Considered looking for a new job if you're not being challenged.
    * Work with, or meet up with other motivated programmers.
    * Make sure you can see the progress you're making.
    * Keep it fresh
    * Don't be afraid of reinventing the wheel!

## Avoid Stagnation

> **Key:** Be wary of stagnation. Seeking to become a better programmer, by definition, is not the most comfortable lifestyle.

### Your Skills Are Your Investment

> **Key:** Expect to invest time and effort to grow your skill set. This is a worthwhile investment; it will repay itself.

### Job Security

 * Being a better developer, one with a more rounded skillset, one who is constantly learning, will increase your job security.
