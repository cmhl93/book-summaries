      * A complete newbie.
    * Advanced beginner
      * At this level there is a better understanding of where to get answers but you are still not at a level where you can comprehend the bigger picture.
    * Competent
      * This stage sees you with a mental model of the problem domain; you've mapped the knowledge base, have begun to associate its parts, and understand the relative importance of difference aspects.
    * Proficient
      * Proficient people move beyond competency. They have a much better understanding of the big picture, and are frustrated with the simplifications that the novice needed.
    * Expert
      * Experts are the authorities on a subject; they know it completely, and can use this skill interlinked with other skills. They can teach others.
