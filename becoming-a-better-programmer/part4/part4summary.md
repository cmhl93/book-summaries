## Smarter, Not Harder

### Pick you battles

####  Battle tactics

##### Reuse Wisely

> **Key:**  Use existing code, rather than writing your own from scratch. Employ your time on more important things

##### Make it someone else's problem

  * Don't work out how to do a task yourself if someone already knows how to do it.

##### Only Do what you have to

##### Put it on a spike

  * A quick spike solution (a throwaway prototype) might generate more useful answers in minutes.

##### Prioritise

> **Key:**  Concentrate effort on the most important things first. What is most urgent, or will produce the most value?

### What's Really Required

  * When you are given a new task, check what's really needed now.
  
#### One Thing at a Time

####  Keep it Small (and Simple)

> **Key:**  Remember KISS: Keep it simple, stupid.

####  Don't Defer and Store Up Problems

####  Automate

> **Key:**  If you do something often, make the computer do it for you. Automate it with a script.

####  Error Prevention

  * To achieve this:
      * Show your product to customers early and often
      * Discuss your code design with others
      * Code review small
      * Unit-test code from the outset.
      
####  Communicate

  * Learn to communicate better. Learn how to ask the right questions to understand unambiguously.
  
####  Avoid Burnout

  * Don't burn yourself out working silly hours, leading people to expect unrealistic levels of work from you all the time.
  
####  Power Tools

  * Always look out for new tools that will boost your workflow
  
## It's Done When It's Done

### Developing Backwards: Decomposition

> **Key:**  Split large tasks up into a series of smaller, well-understood tasks. You will be able to judge progress through these more accurately.

### Define "Done"

> **Key:**  Make sure you define "done".

> **Key:**  If you can't tell when it's done, then you shouldn't start it.

  * Your "done" criteria needs to be:
      * clear
      * visible
      * achievable
      
> **Key:**  Use tests written in code to define when your code is complete and working.

### Just Do It

> **Key:**  Don't do more work than necessary. Work until you're "done". Then stop.

## This Time I've Got It

### Desert Island Development

> **Key:**  Be accountable to another programmer. Review progress them regularly.

### Stood at the Bottom of the Mountain

> **Key:**  When facing a problem, make sure you've considered more than one approach to solve it. Only then should you start working on it.
