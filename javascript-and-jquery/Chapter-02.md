# Basic JavaScript Instructions

[Statements](#statements)

##  Statements

  * A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.  Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.  Statements should end with a semicolon.
  * Javascript is Case sensitive
  * Statements are instructions and each one starts on a new line.
    * The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter when a step is over, indicating that it should move to the next step
  * Statements can be organized into code blocks
    * Some statements are surrounded by curly braces; these are known as code blocks.  The closing curly brace is not followed by a semicolon.
    
##  Comments

  * You should write comments to explain what your code does.
  * They help make your code easier to read and understand.
  * Multi-line comments
    * To write a comment that stretches over more than one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with the /* characters and ending with the */ characters. 
  * Single-line comments
    * In a single-line comment, anything that follows the two forward slash characters // on that line will not be processed by the JavaScript interpreter.
    
## What is a variable?

 * A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job.  It can store this data in variables.
 * A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs
 * The result is said to be calculated or computed 
 
## Variables: How to declare them

 * Before you can use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it.
 * `var quantity;`
 * var is an example of what programmers call a keyword.
 * In order to use the variable, you must give it a name. (This is sometimes called an identified.)
   * In this case, the variable is called quantity.  
 * In a variable name is more than one word, it is usually written in camelCase.
 
## Variables: How to assign them a value

 * Once you have created a variable, you can tell it what information you would like it to store for you.
 * `quantity = 3;`
 * Here we set a value for the variable called quantity.
 * The equals sign (=) is an assignment operator. It says that you are going to assign a value to the variable.  It is also used to update the value given to a variable.
 * Until you have assigned a value to a variable, programmers say the value is undefined.
 * Where a variable is declared can have an effect upon whether the rest of the script can use it.  Programmers call this the scope of a variable.
 
## Data Types

 * JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.
 * Numeric Data Type
  * The numeric data type handles numbers
 * String Data Type
  * The strings data type consists of letters and other characters
 * Boolean Data Type
  * Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false.

 * Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:
