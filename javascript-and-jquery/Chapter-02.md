##  Statements

  * A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.  Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.  Statements should end with a semicolon.
  * Javascript is Case sensitive
  * Statements are instructions and each one starts on a new line.
    * The semicolon also tells the JavaScript interpreter when a step is over, indicating that it should move to the next step
  * Statements can be organized into code blocks
    * Some statements are surrounded by curly braces; these are known as code blocks.  The closing curly brace is not followed by a semicolon.
    
##  Comments

  * You should write comments to explain what your code does.
  * They help make your code easier to read and understand.
  * Multi-line comments
    * To write a comment that stretches over more than one line, you use a multi-line comment, starting with the /* characters and ending with the */ characters. 
  * Single-line comments
    * In a single-line comment, anything that follows the two forward slash characters // on that line will not be processed by the JavaScript interpreter.
