##  What is a script?

  * A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.  
    * You can compare scripts to any of the following:
      * Recipes
      * Handbooks
      * Manuals
    * Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step.
    * A browser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
    * Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.
  * To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in orfer to achieve it.
    * Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
      1.  Define the goal
        * You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.
      2.  Design the script
        * To design a script you split the goal into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle
        * Each individual tasks may be broken down into a sequence of steps.  
          * When you are ready to code the script, these steps can then be translated into individual lines of code.
      3.  Code each step
        * Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands.
