##  Getting acquainted with SPA

  * SPA is a web application or website that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience 
  and a rich interface.
  * Such applications can vary from a small simple create, read, update, and delete (CRUD), like a to-do list, until it reaches 
  a more complex level with countless views, libraries, templates, scripts, and validations.
  * The main goal about this kind of web application is to be able to update parts of an interface without sending or receiving a 
  full-page request.
  * Understanding the work of SPAs
    * Model View Controller (MVC), Model View Presenter (MVP), and Model ViewViewModel (MVVM) 
  * Understanding the MVC/MVVM/MV* pattern
    * MVC is a software architecture pattern that emerged in the 1980s, and it separates the visual representation of information 
    from the user's interaction.
    * We use JavaScript to model our application according to the standards of MVC on the client side and not on the server.
    * Development models:
      * Presentation Model (PM)

      * Model View Presenter (MVP)

      * Model View Controller (MVC)
      * Model View ViewModel (MVVM)
        ![Pictorial representation of MVVM](http://i66.tinypic.com/332sdva.jpg)
        * MVVM is based on MVC and MVP, which attempts to separate more clearly the development of User Interfaces (UIs/frontend) 
        from  that of the business logic and behavior in an application.
